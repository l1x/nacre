{"id":"nacre-11s.3","title":"Rewrite Graph view with proper dependency visualization","description":"# Rewrite Graph View with Proper Dependency Visualization\n\n## Current Implementation Analysis\n\n### Backend (handlers.rs:289-470)\n- Loads all issues, builds dependency graph via topological sort (BFS)\n- Groups nodes by level based on dependency depth\n- Fixed grid positions: left-to-right per level, top-to-bottom for levels\n- Static SVG with positions calculated server-side (~180 lines)\n\n### Frontend (graph.html)\n- Static SVG rendered server-side via Askama template\n- Type filters (epic, feature, bug, task, chore)\n- Expand/collapse buttons for epics with children\n- In-page JavaScript (~110 lines, not modular TypeScript)\n\n## Problems with Current Implementation\n\n### Layout Issues\n1. Fixed grid layout doesn't scale with many nodes (horizontal overflow)\n2. No edge-crossing minimization - lines overlap confusingly\n3. All nodes shown at once is overwhelming for large projects\n4. Expand/collapse doesn't re-layout (just hides nodes in place)\n\n### Interactivity Limitations\n1. No pan/zoom for large graphs\n2. No node dragging for manual repositioning\n3. Static positions calculated once on server load\n\n### Visual Issues\n1. Edge arrows overlap nodes when dense\n2. Straight lines cross over other nodes\n3. No distinction between dependency types (parent-child vs blocks)\n\n### Data Model Confusion\n1. Mixes parent-child relationships with blocking dependencies\n2. Dot-notation parsing (nacre-3hd.1) for implicit parent-child is fragile\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Approach: Simplified Hierarchical Tree\n\n**Recommendation**: Don't try to visualize all dependency types in one graph. Instead:\n\n### Phase 1: Epic Tree View (Simple)\n- Show epics as collapsible tree nodes (like file explorer)\n- Children nested under parent epics\n- Click to expand/collapse\n- Status indicators (colored dots)\n- Link to issue detail on click\n\n**Benefits**: Simple, performant, clear hierarchy\n\n### Phase 2: Dependency Overlay (Optional)\n- On hover/focus, show which issues block/are blocked by selected issue\n- Highlight edges only for selected node\n- Avoids visual clutter of showing all edges at once\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option A: HTML/CSS Tree (Recommended)\n- Use `\u003cul\u003e/\u003cli\u003e` with CSS for indentation\n- Collapsible via existing list.ts toggle pattern\n- No external libraries needed\n- Server-side rendered, progressive enhancement\n\n### Option B: D3.js Force-Directed\n- Dynamic layout, pan/zoom\n- Better for complex graphs\n- Adds ~100KB dependency\n- More complex to implement\n\n### Option C: Dagre/ELK Layered Layout\n- Proper DAG algorithm, minimizes crossings\n- Requires JS library\n- Good middle ground\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Implementation (Option A)\n\n1. **Remove current SVG-based graph** (~180 lines backend, ~110 lines JS)\n2. **Create tree template** similar to epics.html structure\n3. **Reuse list.ts** expand/collapse logic\n4. **Add to navigation.ts** for keyboard nav (j/k to move, Enter to expand)\n5. **Filter by status** (open only, all, etc.)\n\n### Data Structure\n```\nEpic 1\n├── Task 1.1 (open)\n├── Task 1.2 (in_progress)\n└── Task 1.3 (closed)\nEpic 2\n└── Feature 2.1\n    ├── Task 2.1.1\n    └── Bug 2.1.2\nStandalone Task (no parent)\n```\n\n### Blocked-by Indicator\n- Small icon/badge showing \"blocked by X\" count\n- Click to see blockers in tooltip or side panel\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Tree view shows epics with expandable children\n- [ ] Status indicated visually (color dot or badge)\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (j/k/Enter)\n- [ ] Filter by issue type\n- [ ] Click navigates to issue detail\n- [ ] Responsive (no horizontal overflow)\n- [ ] Blocked issues have visual indicator","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-25T22:44:03.845766+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T20:57:26.1652+01:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-28T20:57:26.1652+01:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"feature"}
